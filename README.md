HouseMusic

HouseMusic is a webapp that allows users to record and loop their own recordings to make a short music sample. Although other similar applications such as Splice Beatmaker (https://splice.com/sounds/beatmaker) exist, they do not allow for real-time collaboration between users, while ours does. Our application will be lightweight and portable to allow for quick and easy editing, but is free for all users. 

Although the main scope of the project is to create music loops, some other features include real-time collaboration, saving your project, adding clips from your device, recording your own voice, and exporting as an mp3. Our app also features user login support, which allows the users to save and load their music projects.

The target audience will be those who are interested in creating their own music but donâ€™t have experience working with recording software. This app is a mix of both entertainment and education. While anybody of any skill level can log in and create music in seconds, more experienced music creators can also use this app to create music loops to use in projects. With this app multiple users can quickly make a short sample of their idea before committing to a full project if they so desire to.

We believe that the scope of this project is appropriate, as it incorporates multiple APIs, includes socket.io real-time functionality, implements a browser based login system, and has at least as many epics as people in our group. We also believe that the amount of work required in this proposal is enough for five group members.
